Moments in which a user has a need so specific, no amount of automation or artificial intelligence is capable of assisting them and so humans must intervene. When this happens, our agent, equipped with the expertise and eloquence befitting our industry, promptly follows guidelines that are in no way designed to hinder their humanity or emotional intelligence. These two fundamental qualities distinguish between an excellent and flawed interaction.

We have no business telling our agents exactly what to say in every case - the ongoing maintenance cost of this approach is stupidly large and its quality is highly disputable.

How many queries an agent resolves, how fast a first response is sent or how quickly a solution is found all depend on the process quality and staffing dynamics present in the support system. You are better off chasing windmills than attributing poor performance to individuals or staff alone. Any deviation in numbers reflects changes previously made, fuelling a continuous feedback loop that shapes guidelines.

Quality is shaped by the reactions of users, giving negative ones attention beyond only the scope of the individual who received it.

To earn the kindness of the user in need, our agent must embody it and be met with kindness on every step towards the solution.
