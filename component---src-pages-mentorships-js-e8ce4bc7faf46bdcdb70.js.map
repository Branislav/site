It's as much about implementing a set of well-thought-out processes\nas it is about having agents who feel empowered to escalate the right\nproblems and turn an unhappy customer into a 5-star review.\nA pretty important function in the grand scale of things, right?\n<br/><br/>\nWell, for how important they are - Support teams rarely get the time they\nneed (and deserve) to establish an effective system, regularly improve\nprocesses and the knowledge base, and especially to work on self-\ndevelopment for each of the agents or people managers. We get stuck in a\ncycle of responding to urgent tickets, putting out fires, and submitting\nfeature requests to the product team. All very important tasks, but not\nones that bring progress in the long run.\n<br/><br/>\nBringing in a mentor helps create that space - there's someone who will\nbe able to look at the full picture from the outside, help identify the areas\nthat need the most attention, and have a tailored approach to each\nindividual.\n<br/><br/>\nThe best part is you don't have to wait for the end of the mentorship\nperiod to see the results! After every session, the mentee has a new set of\nquestions, suggestions, and ideas to start implementing or develop further.\n            </p>\n            <h3 className=\"headingStyles\">\n            <span className=\"headingAccentStyles\">The Deets</span></h3>\n            <p className=\"pageParagraphStyles\">\n                Package: Nudge / Steer / Drive <br/>\n                Duration: One quarter / Two quarters / Longer  <br/>\n                Sessions: Two per month / Two per month / more if needed  <br/>\n                Financials: Get in touch <br/> \n\n\n            </p>\n            <h3 className=\"headingStyles\">\n            <span className=\"headingAccentStyles\">The Process</span></h3>\n            <p className=\"pageParagraphStyles\"> \n                <b>One - Intro call</b><br/><br/>\n                First things first, I want to get to know you, hear about your challenges and what you're hoping to get from the mentorship. \n                Provided we're a good match and my expertise can be of help, we can choose the track that makes the most sense for your specific situation. <br/><br/>\n                <b>Two - Data Gathering</b><br/><br/>\n                Before our first session, you'll receive a detailed questionnaire where you can share relevant details. \n                This includes more about you, the goals you want to work on, and how you prefer to learn.
