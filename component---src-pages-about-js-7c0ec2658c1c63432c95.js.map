This has decreased resolution time by 10x and increased customer satisfaction by 25%. I've spent the last eight years thinking about excellent support interactions and how to achieve them on a tight budget.\n            <br/><br/>\n            I enjoy solving puzzles and creating amazing customer experiences.\n            <br/><br/>\n            Outside of business hours, you'll find me tinkering with technology, indoor swimming (and losing the race against Dutch grandmas), cycling and enjoying good food. I was born and raised in Serbia, but I've lived in the Netherlands for over a decade.\n            <br/><br/>\n            This website is the space where you can read about my Support philosophy, find tips and tricks, or find out how you could work with me. \n            </p>\n            \n            <Footer/>\n        </main>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default AboutPage\n\nexport const Head = () => <title>About me</title>"],"names":["AboutPage","React","className","Header","class","src","image","alt","Footer","Head"],"sourceRoot":""}
